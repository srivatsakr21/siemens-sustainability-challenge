# Our approach
We scraped the data that was given to us in .docx format are created a well structured data about companies, its goals and actions. This data was then used to find out what individual company is doing and what are the common topics on sustainability that all companies are working on. Below we show some of the common topics that all the companies are working on. From this we can see that <b>GHG emissions, renewable energy, sustainable supply chain, and packaging</b> are some of the hot topics companies are interested in.

# Public Perception
In this digital world, public perception about a company becomes very important. A positive perception gives the companies a satisfaction that they are moving in the right direction and a negative perception could show the companies some opportunities for improvements. To gather public perception about companies' sustainability actions we decided to analyse tweets. As reaction from twitter comes instantly after the sustainability reports are released we extracted the tweets covering the dates when the reports were released. What we found out was rather shocking. For instance, when microsoft released their reports, people were mainly talking about their offering of a impact emissions dashboard and their approach towards cloud sustainability. Ã‰ven though they did other actions such as investing in proper waste management and water management, these actions were not talked about. Decarbonization and being carbon neurtal are 2 actions that are very well received by the public and these actions are talked about across all companies.

Similar to microsoft, when siemens sustainability reports were released, trending hashtags were <b>#hydrogenday, #fuelcellday, #carbonneutral</b>.

On the contrary, for companies like <b>Walt Disney, TD Bank</b>, even though they highlighted about actions like reducing emissions, better waste management, reaching GHG target, their actions have gone unnoticed by people on twitter.

Overall we see a positive sentiment from people for sustainbale actions of very popular companies.

# Conclusion
According to our analysis, more tangible actions seem to be well received. However, those actions that are not marketed enough are unnoticed. Twitter likes to talk only about actions of very famous corporations and tend to overlook the good things done by some lesser known corporations.
